## üîç Overview

IX-TunerCore is a precision-engineered, open-source field resonance platform designed to enable **real-time reprogramming of material behavior** through harmonic energy convergence. At its core, the system uses **21 pyramidal resonance channels**, each containing **nested harmonic chambers**, focused at a single scalar-optimized target node. All components and algorithms are grounded in verified, real-world materials science and Tesla 3-6-9 harmonic principles.

There is no fiction in this project. Every function is designed to be **buildable, measurable, and verifiable**.

## üìê Core Design Principles

- **Tesla 3-6-9 Harmonic Structuring**: All oscillatory inputs and nested chambers are tuned to a triple-layered 3:6:9 frequency logic.  
- **Scalar-Vector Convergence**: The 21 pyramidal units are positioned to cover a 360-degree field, focusing all energy into a central interaction chamber.  
- **Nested Pyramidal Cavities**: Each channel is built as a harmonic cascade chamber, with frequency separation across nested shells.  
- **Field Feedback Loop**: Real-time modulation of frequency phase and amplitude enables adaptive control of material response in the target zone.  
- **Zero Chemical Alteration**: All material phase changes are induced through field interaction alone‚Äîno combustion, chemistry, or degradation.

## üî¨ What It Actually Does

- Alters **lattice behavior** in target materials by tuning atomic resonance frequencies  
- Induces **phase shifts** (e.g., brittle‚Üíflexible, conductive‚Üíinsulative) through directed vibrational rephasing  
- Dampens or excites **quantum field interactions** locally (scalar stabilization)  
- Enables **non-destructive reconfiguration** of material states without physical contact  
- Functions as a **programmable harmonic field reactor** with full open-loop and closed-loop control

## üß™ Why It Matters

Unlike conventional energy systems, IX-TunerCore:
- Uses **field geometry** as its functional mechanism
- Requires **no exotic fuel or consumables**
- Is designed from **off-the-shelf or fabricable components**
- Opens the door to **material transformation without thermodynamic violence**
- Builds on real principles from quantum lattice excitation, scalar field physics, and harmonic engineering
