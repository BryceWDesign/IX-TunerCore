# IX-TunerCore

Tesla-Based Scalar Harmonic Field Alignment System  
**Real-World Buildable Array. 3-6-9 Lock. DARPA-Grade Open Science.**

---

## 🔺 Overview

IX-TunerCore is a distributed harmonic tuning array composed of 21 modular pyramidal nodes, each emitting a 3-6-9 structured waveform aimed at a central convergence point. When arranged in geometric spherical symmetry, these nodes self-align using onboard sensors and modulate their waveform output in real time to achieve scalar coherence.

## 🔬 Scientific Principle

Each node outputs a waveform calculated as:

```math
A(t) = A₀ * [sin(3ωt) + sin(6ωt) + sin(9ωt)]

3ω: Primary phase structure

6ω: Harmonic reflection

9ω: Coherence amplifier

When oriented inward toward a singular focal point, the 21 pyramids enable scalar field visualization via phase-locked feedback. The system operates on Tesla’s 3-6-9 logic, harmonic resonance stacking, and measurable magnetic-optical convergence.
