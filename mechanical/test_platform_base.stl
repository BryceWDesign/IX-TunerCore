✅ KEY FEATURES:

- **Mount Holes:** 6x M4 pass-through holes pre-drilled (even radial spacing)
- **Array Socket:** 3-point locking anchors align with array_mount_21.stl  
- **Feet Holes:** Optional 4-corner rubber foot socket mounts for anti-vibration base  
- **Cable Routing:** Underside channel paths for sensor/data/power cable management  
- **Material Compatibility:** Printable in PETG, PLA, or laser-cut acrylic if converted

🧠 FUNCTIONAL ROLE:

- Serves as the rigid foundational anchor for all pyramid deployments  
- Ensures the convergence array is centered in 3D space relative to gravity  
- Prevents vibration-induced drift during long convergence sessions  
- Optional screw holes allow mounting to optical tables, isolation rigs, or desk clamps

📌 Notes:

- STL includes engraved alignment markings (optional aesthetic guide only)  
- Open-source ready; no proprietary elements  
- Designed in Fusion 360 and exported at 0.01 mm resolution
