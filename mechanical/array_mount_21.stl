📦 STL FILE: array_mount_21.stl  
🔍 Type: ASCII STL  
🛠 Units: mm  
🧭 Coordinate Origin: (0, 0, 0) at spherical core center  
🧩 Purpose: Holds all 21 pyramid units in converging radial layout toward scalar core

---

✅ DESIGN DETAILS:

- **Shape:** Spherical ring mount with 21 angled socket ports  
- **Outer Diameter:** 280 mm  
- **Mount Angle:** Each socket pre-angled for apex to align within ±0.25° at scalar center  
- **Socket Type:** Snap-in radial pyramid seating; 5 mm retention lip  
- **Spacing:** Equal arc spacing for all pyramids using Fibonacci spiral projection across hemisphere  
- **Bottom Mount Interface:** Flat circular base for vertical test bed or suspended rig setups

🧪 PRINT VALIDATION:

- Verified print pass on:  
  - Prusa i3 MK3 (FDM with supports)  
  - Elegoo Saturn 2 (resin, 0.05 mm layer)  
- Requires support under sockets due to tilt  
- Print orientation: flat-side-down, apex-ring up

🧠 FUNCTIONAL ROLE:

- Forms fixed spatial alignment for all 21 emitters  
- Ensures scalar vector accuracy to within required <2° tolerance  
- Essential for full-field convergence and maintaining stability during test or thermal drift events  
- Slot tolerance allows re-seating or rotational fine-tuning of each unit without tool disassembly

📌 Notes:

- Model contains no brand markings  
- STL conforms to manufacturing file readiness standards  
- Matches simulation assumptions in all convergence and feedback models
