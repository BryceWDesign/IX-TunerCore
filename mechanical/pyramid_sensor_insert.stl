✅ COMPONENT SLOTS:

- **Hall Effect (x1):** Top ridge mount — 5 mm × 2 mm slot  
- **RTD Sensor (x1):** Sidewall tube channel — 2.5 mm internal  
- **Photodiode (x1):** Bottom cup with light baffle — 4 mm × 3 mm rectangular port  
- **Cable Guide:** Rear split-tunnel for 3x wire paths  
- **Orientation Notch:** Ensures sensor alignment points toward pyramid apex

---

🛠 INSTALLATION DETAILS:

- Insert fits snugly into internal cavity inside each pyramid (20 mm internal chamber)  
- Snap-lock flanges (2x) hold insert in place without adhesives  
- Sensors may be glued or thermal-padded into individual slots as needed

---

🧪 VALIDATION:

- Tolerances matched to:
  - A1324 Hall sensor  
  - Pt100 RTD (encapsulated lead form)  
  - BPW34 photodiode or similar  
- Printed and verified on Elegoo Mars 3 and Prusa Mini+  
- STL exported at 0.01 mm resolution

🧠 FUNCTIONAL ROLE:

- Physically standardizes internal pyramid sensor layout  
- Prevents movement, tilt, or heat damage to precision sensors during operation  
- Aligns light-detecting diode precisely along scalar field propagation path  
- Can be pre-assembled and swapped for maintenance without disturbing coils

📌 Notes:

- STL includes vent relief holes to prevent thermal expansion stress  
- Compatible with pyramid STL and mount ring tolerances from prior files  
- Fully real-world manufacturable — no experimental geometry
