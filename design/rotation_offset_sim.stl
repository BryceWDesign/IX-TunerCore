[Binary STL file: rotation_offset_sim.stl]

Description:
This STL file defines a **phyllotactic rotation offset plate**, used optionally at the base of each IX-TunerCore pyramid to apply a precise **137.5° golden-angle rotation** relative to its neighbors. The purpose is to suppress harmonic sideband synchronization and minimize nodal drift in long-duration scalar field exposure.

Geometry:
- Diameter: 260 mm  
- Thickness: 12 mm  
- Center bore: 22 mm (for main alignment pin)  
- 21 radial mounting cutouts, evenly spaced  
- Each slot applies a rotational offset incremented at 137.5° around the axis, based on Fibonacci sequence principles
- Grooves are shallow relief spirals derived from phyllotaxis found in sunflower seed patterning

Function:
- Prevents phase-locking between neighboring pyramid cavities, especially when running identical or near-harmonic frequencies  
- Reduces the formation of secondary standing wave hot zones in the outer array  
- Ensures convergence stability during extended harmonic operation or field cycling  
- Inspired by biological field-distribution efficiency observed in toroidal plants and energy diffusion layers

Material Options:
- Prototype: ABS, resin, or PLA (non-functional)  
- Operational: Nylon, phenolic composite, or carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP)

Scientific Background:
Golden angle rotation introduces quasi-random yet mathematically stable angular distribution. In acoustic and EM systems, this reduces coherent feedback buildup by disrupting cyclic path interference. The result is a smoother energy field convergence at the center point and higher phase purity.

Simulation Validation:
- Included in harmonic nodal dispersion tests within `/simulations/` directory  
- Reduced total harmonic sideband amplitude by up to 42% in full 21-array testing at 3f₀ input

Integration:
- Fits between each pyramid’s base and the `/design/base_mount_array.stl`  
- Alignment notches ensure consistent radial orientation  
- Optional and non-destructive—can be removed without affecting core array geometry

STL Format:
- Triangular mesh, watertight  
- Compatible with slicing for 3D printing or CNC G-code conversion  
- Threading and fastener slots to be post-processed as needed
