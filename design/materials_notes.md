## üå°Ô∏è Environmental Factors Considered

- **Thermal Drift Tolerance**: All field-facing materials must remain structurally stable from ‚àí40¬∞C to 250¬∞C  
- **Magnetic Permittivity**: All core-facing materials must exhibit near-zero magnetic response to prevent field warping  
- **Dielectric Stability**: Materials exposed to standing wave nodes must not accumulate charge or exhibit piezoelectric breakdown  
- **Field Absorption**: Internal components must minimize eddy current generation or signal loss through self-resonance

## üî¨ Material Source Compatibility

All listed materials:
- Are available through major suppliers (McMaster-Carr, RS Components, Thorlabs, Edmund Optics, etc.)  
- Require no rare-earth or restricted international components  
- Are compliant with U.S. export controls and non-military open-source distribution

## üö´ Materials to Avoid

| Material           | Reason for Exclusion                                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ferrous metals     | Interfere with scalar node and harmonic containment           |
| PVC / Vinyl        | Field-reactive, outgasses under thermal stress                |
| Organic polymers   | Unpredictable field resonance, charge retention over time     |
| Aluminum foil      | Causes uncontrolled reflection of phase-locked waveforms      |
