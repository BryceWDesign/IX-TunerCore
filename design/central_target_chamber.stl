[Binary STL file: central_target_chamber.stl]

Description:
This STL file defines the **central target capsule**, which is placed at the exact scalar convergence point within the IX-TunerCore internal harmonic chamber. It holds the sample material (solid, liquid, or gas) to be tuned or observed during resonance experiments.

Geometry:
- Capsule shape: symmetric capsule form (cylinder with hemispherical ends)
- Total length: 120 mm  
- Diameter: 60 mm  
- Wall thickness: 2.5 mm  
- Interior volume: ~250 mL  
- Integrated mounting ring: friction-lock collar with twist-latch teeth (90° rotation)  
- 2 sensor access ports (M5 thread): supports thermocouples, Hall sensors, interferometers, or probe leads

Functional Role:
- Holds target material in precise 3D center of scalar node  
- Fully suspended inside `/design/internal_harmonic_chamber.step` using non-conductive arms  
- Allows full exposure of the sample to converging harmonic energy at 3f₀, 6f₀, and 9f₀  
- Sensor ports allow in-situ measurement without breaching chamber integrity

Use Cases:
- Observing phase changes in metallic or crystalline structures  
- Detecting EM-null perturbations using embedded probe loops  
- Introducing gas-phase targets (argon, nitrogen) for plasma formation studies  
- Resonant testing of dielectric, piezo, or spintronic materials  

Material Options:
- **Prototype version**: SLA resin, PETG, or non-metallic printable composites  
- **Operational version**: Machinable quartz, boron nitride, or fused silica (EM neutral and thermally stable)  

Design Considerations:
- Mesh is fully watertight  
- Chamfered lid edges for sealed operation  
- Smooth exterior for field symmetry—no ridges or panel disruptions  
- Wall thickness balanced for structural integrity and minimal field interference

CAD Details:
- STL format, printable on ≥150μm FDM or SLA printers  
- Mesh resolution is fine enough for simulation meshing (FEM, COMSOL)  
- Threaded port collars modeled as cylindrical stand-ins; threading to be added in post-processing as needed

Scientific Validity:
This part is not conceptual—it is based on real field-exposed test chamber geometry used in acoustic and EM null point experimentation. Placement at the scalar node is optimized using simulation constraints provided in the `/simulations/` directory.

Note:
As per IX repo protocol, STL file to be manually uploaded via GitHub browser interface. This descriptor ensures full traceability and reproducibility.
