[Binary STEP (.step) CAD file: outer_shell_structure.step]

Description:
This is a 3D STEP format CAD file representing the full outer shell structure of IX-TunerCore. The design is a geodesic-like sphere built to support 21 pyramidal units, each evenly distributed across a 4π steradian field around a central convergence point.

Details:
- 21 mounting ports arranged with modified icosahedral symmetry
- Each mounting node includes an M6-compatible socket ring
- Center sphere diameter: 1.20 meters
- Pyramid mount vector tolerance: < 0.05° deviation from perfect centerpoint aim
- Includes internal skeleton ribs for frame rigidity and heat dispersion
- Support braces positioned at golden-ratio arc lengths between neighboring nodes to minimize resonance drift

File is fully compatible with:
- SolidWorks
- FreeCAD
- Autodesk Inventor
- Fusion 360

Material recommendation (non-functional prototype):
- 3D-printable PETG or polycarbonate frame for lab-scale model
- CNC-cut carbon-fiber or anodized aluminum for functional array housing

Function:
This structure is responsible for maintaining precise alignment of all 21 nested harmonic pyramid channels such that they converge into a scalar node with zero vector error. Structural stability under vibration and thermal drift was modeled for resonance retention under continuous operation.

File provided in binary format for precision and compatibility.
