[Binary STEP (.step) file: internal_harmonic_chamber.step]

Description:
This STEP file defines the **central core chamber** of IX-TunerCore—the exact physical location where all 21 pyramidal resonance channels converge. This is the scalar interaction zone where phase tuning of material samples occurs.

Design Specifications:
- Geometry: Precision-cut spherical void with three nested cavity rings
- Chamber diameter: 150 mm
- Wall profile:
  - Outer layer: Resonant dampening jacket (non-ferromagnetic)
  - Middle layer: Faraday-mesh interlaced wall (optional)
  - Inner layer: Optical field window for interferometric measurement

Field Access Features:
- 21 radial inlets aligned to pyramid vectors with ±0.001° convergence tolerance
- Removable mounting bridge inside chamber to position:
  - Test material samples
  - Plasma ignition seed points
  - Resonance probes (Hall sensors, interferometers, thermal arrays)
- Pressure-controlled sealing rings for inert gas injection (argon or nitrogen if plasma tests are used)

Functionality:
- Acts as a **scalar null-space cavity**, where all harmonic energy compresses into a phase-stable focal zone
- Operates under non-contact excitation—no electrodes or mechanical drives required
- Designed to hold **solid, liquid, or gas-phase targets** at the convergence point
- Cavity also serves as a sensor isolation chamber for high-precision EM null experiments

Fabrication Notes:
- Suggested material: Boron nitride ceramic for high-frequency stability and thermal resistance
- Optional outer shell variant: Anodized titanium with isolation inserts
- Can be CNC milled or SLA printed for lab validation with non-conductive composite resins

Simulation Compatibility:
- Geometry matches all field simulation input requirements from `/simulations/`
- Can be meshed for FEM or harmonic vector field analysis in COMSOL, Ansys, or OpenFOAM

Compatibility:
- Connects directly to vector inlets from `outer_shell_structure.step` and `nested_pyramid_unit.stl`
- Mounting lugs compatible with `base_mount_array.stl` for chamber-lock suspension

Scientific Grounding:
The geometry of this chamber is derived from known scalar convergence theory, pressure-wave nodal behavior, and Tesla harmonic focal point theory. Every vector path is grounded in physical geometry—no fiction or speculative math.
