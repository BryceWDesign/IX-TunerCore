# Scalar Chamber Assembly Protocol

This document provides a **precision, step-by-step assembly process** for the IX-TunerCore central scalar convergence chamber. This includes:

- Installation of all field-facing components  
- Mechanical mounting tolerances  
- Alignment strategies  
- Sensor port integration  
- Best practices for field purity preservation

There are no estimated stepsâ€”this is a real-world build guide.

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

Ensure the following components are pre-fabricated and on hand:
- `/design/internal_harmonic_chamber.step`  
- `/design/field_focus_lens.step`  
- `/design/central_target_chamber.stl`  
- `/design/rotation_offset_sim.stl` (optional)  
- `/hardware/field_stabilizer_layout.md` components  
- Alignment jigs (3D printed or machined)  
- Non-metallic torque tools (ceramic or nylon-based)

## ðŸ§­ Assembly Steps

### 1. Prepare Chamber Core

- Clean all surfaces with isopropyl alcohol (99% grade)  
- Verify optical clarity if chamber is made of fused silica or quartz  
- Inspect all radial inlet paths for debris or warping (Â±0.01 mm tolerance)

### 2. Install Field Focus Lens

- Place lens against interior lens ring of chamber wall  
- Ensure phyllotactic groove side faces inward (toward scalar center)  
- Secure using compression-lock retaining ring (do not over-torque)

### 3. Mount Central Target Capsule

- Insert capsule into center using ceramic armature or field-neutral support ring  
- Position sample (solid or encased liquid/gas) precisely at 3D origin of chamber volume  
- Optional: Insert thermocouple or Hall sensor via side port threading (M5)

### 4. Wrap Scalar Null Shell

- Apply Mu-metal braid around outer chamber circumference, avoiding overlap  
- Fix with low-pressure PTFE ring bands at 3 axial positions (top, mid, bottom)  
- DO NOT crimp braid endsâ€”use conductive adhesive pads for grounding if needed

### 5. Layer Field Stabilizers

- Apply absorptive foam sheets (carbon-loaded or aerogel) to inner cavity walls  
- Insert vibration dampers between chamber and mount brackets  
- Confirm all inner stabilizer layers are symmetrical and pressure-balanced

### 6. Insert into Outer Shell Frame

- Align chamber ports to match outer pyramid vector pathways  
- Use alignment jig to verify vector aim within Â±0.25Â°  
- Secure using 3-point radial compression clamps (nylon or PEEK plastic)

## ðŸŽ¯ Alignment Notes

- Use a laser collimator or optical targeting reticle to verify center convergence  
- Ideal scalar focus point must sit within Â±1 mm of geometric node  
- Use phase-mapped signal tracing (from DDS driver) to detect any convergence drift

## ðŸ“‹ Safety Checklist (Before Activation)

| Item                                 | Status       |
|--------------------------------------|--------------|
| No metal shavings, dust, or tape     | âœ… Required   |
| No asymmetric fastener stress        | âœ… Required   |
| Sample is securely suspended         | âœ… Required   |
| Sensor leads insulated and shielded  | âœ… Required   |
| Scalar node clearance verified       | âœ… Required   |

## âœ… Summary

This chamber assembly protocol ensures that all IX-TunerCore scalar operations are **field-stable**, **symmetrical**, and **physically valid**. Every step can be completed using known tools and materials. No magical tolerances. No non-buildable steps. The chamber becomes a clean, testable, and instrument-ready core of the entire system.

Maintain precision. Maintain symmetry. Respect phase alignment.
