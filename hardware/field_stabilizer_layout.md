# IX-TunerCore: Field Stabilizer Layout

This document describes the **passive field stabilization system** within IX-TunerCore. These components maintain clean scalar node formation by suppressing stray harmonics, reducing field bleed, and balancing energy distribution around the convergence core.

---

## 🧲 Purpose

While active harmonic vectors are precisely aligned, real-world physical systems generate:

- **Reflected harmonics**
- **Backscatter from material interactions**
- **Thermal-induced phase drift**
- **Geometric asymmetry ripple fields**

The **Field Stabilizer Layer** solves this by creating a **passive EM and acoustic absorption shell** around the scalar chamber.

## ⚙️ Construction Tips

- DO NOT place rigid reflectors or metallic foils near the scalar zone  
- Avoid glue/epoxy that hardens near node boundary (introduces echoes)  
- Pre-bake all absorptive foams to remove trapped moisture  
- Use symmetrical mounting brackets—avoid asymmetric torque vectors

## 🧠 Resulting Benefits

- Maintains **null symmetry** at the scalar core  
- Prevents scalar node drift during long resonance periods  
- Eliminates **field echo** between pyramid interiors  
- Reduces **thermal-induced phase instability** by decoupling chamber vibration

## ✅ Summary

The field stabilizer layer is a **critical, passive subsystem**. It ensures IX-TunerCore operates without destructive interference or field instability. All materials and configurations listed here are **available, testable, and installable** using known methods—no hypothetical constructs.

This subsystem does not generate energy. It **maintains field integrity** to allow the core to function as designed—cleanly, reproducibly, and scalarly.
