[Vector SVG schematic file: power_distribution_schematic.svg]

Description:
This schematic illustrates the **DC power distribution architecture** used in IX-TunerCore. The design ensures each quadrant of the device receives clean, isolated power with minimal EMI contamination or loop instability.

Core Design:
- Input: 48V DC regulated power source (permanent lab supply or battery-backed UPS)
- Topology: Four-quadrant radial power bus
- Isolation: Star-grounded shield ring and independent rail isolation per quadrant

Power Zones:
1. **Driver Rail (per quadrant)**  
   - 48V DC into buck converter  
   - Down-converted to 12V or 5V rails for coil drivers and microcontrollers  
   - Each has its own soft-start and overvoltage protection
  
2. **Sensor Rail (global)**  
   - Low-noise 3.3V LDOs (linear regulators only, no switch-mode allowed)  
   - Shared sensor loop with opto-isolated return

3. **Fan / Auxiliary Rail**  
   - Passive cooling units (brushless 12V fans) per quadrant  
   - Optional, thermally triggered via sensor loop

4. **Master Ground Plane**  
   - All grounds converge at a **single central return node** beneath scalar chamber frame  
   - No ground loop paths allowed  
   - Ground ring shields signal and power paths separately

Key Annotations (in SVG):
- Color-coded paths:  
  - Red = Primary 48V  
  - Blue = Downregulated logic power  
  - Green = Sensor low-noise line  
  - Black = Ground shields  
- Arrows indicate current flow and logic segmentation  
- Diode symbols for backfeed protection  
- Ferrite bead placements called out at key choke points

Physical Implementation:
- PCB mountable or free-wired depending on scale  
- Compatible with modular plug-in regulators or off-the-shelf voltage conditioning boards  
- All current paths modeled for <2% voltage sag under full harmonic load (~3.2 A max per quadrant)

Safety & Compliance:
- Fused at input  
- Overcurrent shunt detection points built into schematic  
- EM field interference minimized via twisted pair and shielded bus paths  
- No exotic power components required; all standard lab-spec hardware

Rendering Format:
- SVG vector file, scalable to high-res print or CAD import  
- Layered with labeled components and editable logic lines
