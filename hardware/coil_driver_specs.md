# IX-TunerCore Coil Driver Specifications

This document outlines the **engineering specifications and performance targets** for the harmonic field driver system powering each of the 21 nested pyramid units. Each unit requires three independent harmonic signals (3f‚ÇÄ, 6f‚ÇÄ, 9f‚ÇÄ) delivered to concentric coils without phase drift or harmonic bleed.

## üß† Recommended Driver Architecture

- **Core Chipset**: Analog Devices AD9833 (basic) or AD9106 (advanced multi-tone)
- **Microcontroller**: STM32F405, RP2040, or ESP32 (for waveform logic + feedback loop)
- **Amplifier Stage**: Class AB linear amp with dual H-bridge output or push-pull FET design
- **Isolation**: Galvanic isolation on ground plane and coil interface (transformer-coupled or optoisolator logic)

---

## üîÅ Per-Pyramid Driver Configuration

Each pyramid requires:
- **3 independent harmonic channels**
- **1 signal conditioning buffer per coil**
- **1 monitoring feedback loop (optional)** for EM backscatter or coil temperature

Total coils in system:
- 21 pyramids √ó 3 coils = 63 driver channels

Deployment Strategy:
- Use **shared signal boards** where possible (1 board per pyramid)
- Synchronize master clock for all driver boards (via TCXO or GPSDO for lab precision)

## üîß Coil Construction Parameters

| Parameter            | Spec                            |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Core type            | Air-core (preferred), ferrite optional for 3f‚ÇÄ only  
| Turns (typical)      | 50‚Äì120 turns per coil            |
| Wire                 | AWG 22‚Äì26 enameled copper        |
| Inductance target    | 100 ¬µH ‚Äì 800 ¬µH per harmonic     |
| Mounting position    | Concentric layers around pyramid cavities  
| Cooling              | Passive air convection or sink tab to chassis

## üß™ Tuning & Feedback

Feedback loop options:
- **Hall effect sensor** for current feedback
- **Thermal probe** (NTC) on coil form for duty cycle throttling
- **Back EMF spectral monitor** via differential amplifier for convergence tuning

Optional enhancements:
- Dynamic phase shift modulation for material-specific response
- Harmonic phase ramping (e.g., sweep from 3f‚ÇÄ to 9f‚ÇÄ in 500 ms) for scalar ignition triggering

## ‚úÖ Summary

These coil drivers form the **active harmonic engine** behind the IX-TunerCore platform. Each channel must deliver clean, isolated, phase-stable energy at precise Tesla 3-6-9 frequencies. The system is **fully buildable** using off-the-shelf signal generators, microcontrollers, and discrete analog components.

There is **zero speculation** in these specs. Everything defined here is reproducible, controllable, and testable using real hardware.
