## 📐 Pyramid Core Units

| Parameter                | Spec                               |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Pyramid Base             | 80 mm × 80 mm (square)             |
| Height                   | 62 mm (golden ratio-tuned)         |
| Material                 | Copper-plated resin + Ferrite core |
| Orientation              | Apex directed to spherical center  |

Each pyramid has internal EM damping, Faraday shielding along base, and minimal inductive coupling across units.

## 🔄 Coil System (per pyramid)

- **3 coils per unit**  
- Coil ID format: `P{i}_C{j}` → e.g., `P5_C2`
- Litz-wound copper, AWG 26, 150 turns, air-core
- Internal resistance: ~3.2Ω per coil
- Inductance: 0.78–0.85 mH
- Peak handling: 500 mA RMS

Each coil is phase-locked to one of the harmonic frequencies: f₃, f₆, or f₉.

## ⚙️ DDS Driver Specs

| Parameter           | Value                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| IC Used             | AD9833 / AD9102 / SiLabs  |
| Channels            | 63 total (21 × 3 coils)   |
| Frequency Range     | 0.1 Hz – 10 MHz           |
| Resolution          | 28–32 bit phase/freq ctrl |
| Communication       | SPI or I²C bus            |
| Control Refresh     | ≥ 1 Hz (default: 10 Hz)   |

Each DDS chip feeds a single coil, allowing independent tuning.
