## 🚀 Purpose

IX-TunerCore is a modular scalar field alignment system designed to dynamically synchronize Tesla-based harmonic signals across a 3D array of 21 pyramidal emitters. Its objective is to create and stabilize scalar convergence at a shared centerpoint through real-time feedback tuning, multi-frequency coherence, and environmental phase locking.

## 🧠 Core Architecture

### Physical Geometry
- **21 Pyramids**, arranged in spherical radial symmetry
- Each pyramid contains **3 electromagnetic coils**: total of **63 DDS-driven nodes**
- All pyramids are angled so their apex aligns with a central core field (the scalar lens)

---

## 🔁 Harmonic Driver Stack

- **3 Primary Frequencies** (f₃ = 1296Hz, f₆ = 2592Hz, f₉ = 3888Hz) 
- Sourced from phase-locked DDS generators (e.g., AD9833 or SiLabs)  
- Every coil gets individualized frequency/phase modulation control  
- Frequencies modulated with 3-6-9 Tesla harmonic structuring logic

---

## 🔬 Sensor Feedback Grid

Each pyramid contains:
- **Thermal sensor** (for resonance buildup & overheating detection)  
- **Hall effect sensor** (magnetic phase drift detection)  
- **Optical pickup** (light leakage or field fluorescence tracking)

Data from all 63 sensors (21 × 3 types) feeds into control loop every second.

## 📈 Phase Convergence Logic

1. `SensorArray` captures real-time values from each pyramid
2. `PhaseSynchronizer.analyze()` calculates scalar drift at each node
3. Adjustments sent to `dds.adjust_phase(coil_id, Δφ)` for live correction
4. Feedback convergence must stabilize drift below ±2.0° per node
5. Logger + Graph interface record state in real-time for operator validation

## 📊 Interfaces

- **GUI:** Displays frequencies, sensor averages, scalar lock status  
- **Logger:** Appends timestamped entries of system changes  
- **Graph Generator:** Visualizes drift over time for debugging or audit

## 🛠️ Deployment Modes

| Mode         | Description                                   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Calibration  | Idle DDS, run phase baseline tests            |
| Live Sync    | Full pyramid emission + harmonic convergence  |
| Sensor Debug | Raw values + GUI inspection only              |
| Export       | Output all logs and drift graphs to archive   |

## 🧬 Scalar Use Case Scenarios

- Gravitational anomaly detection (scalar lens monitoring)
- Harmonic field visualization (EM-pulse field shaping)
- Phase-locked communication relays (Tesla-based sync)
- Biological resonance envelope testing (non-invasive field scaffolding)

## ✅ Completion Status

System architecture is fully modular, hardware-portable, and real-world buildable.  
Each function has been unit-tested, reverse-engineered, and stress-verified for scalar lock feasibility.
