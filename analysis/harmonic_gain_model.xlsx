📊 Sheet: HGF_Model
Purpose: Model harmonic gain factor (HGF) across multiple pyramid node phase drifts, magnetic offsets, and light alignment errors

📈 Columns:
Node_ID	Phase_Error (deg)	Mag_Field_T	Optical_V	HGF
0–20	[input]	[input]	[input]	[formula]

🔬 Formula Logic (Cell E2 and down):

=IF(ABS(B2)<1, C2*D2/(1+ABS(B2)), 0)
Where:

B2 = Phase error in degrees

C2 = Magnetic field in Tesla

D2 = Optical sensor voltage

HGF drops to 0 if phase drift exceeds ±1° (lockout condition)

📈 Output Graphs:
Harmonic Gain vs Node #

Gain Collapse Visualization (for outlier nodes)

3D surface plot (HGF vs Phase Error vs Field Strength)

✅ Tooling:
Designed for Excel 2016+

Compatible with LibreOffice Calc

Color-coded conditional formatting for:

Phase drift thresholds

Gain loss hotspots

Converged vs disrupted nodes

📂 Placement path:

/analysis/harmonic_gain_model.xlsx
🧠 Purpose:

Predicts which nodes are losing harmonic sync

Provides a scalar-lock diagnostic in numerical form

Replaces subjective “tuning by eye” with real gain collapse math

Critical for multi-node system validation or failure prediction during drift
