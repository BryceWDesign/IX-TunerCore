# IX-TunerCore: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

---

## ❓ What is IX-TunerCore?

A real-time harmonic field array system composed of 21 pyramid-shaped nodes, each tuned to emit a Tesla 3-6-9 harmonic structure and lock into scalar phase coherence through sensory feedback.

---

## ❓ Is this a scalar wave generator?

No. IX-TunerCore is a **scalar tuning and observation system**. It does not generate scalar waves in the fringe sense but rather synchronizes harmonic oscillations to observe convergence, field coherence, and possible gravitational coupling at singular points.

---

## ❓ What is the purpose of the 3-6-9 sine overlap?

Tesla’s harmonic system proposes energy structuring follows specific numerical relationships. In TunerCore:
- `3ω` stabilizes the field's structural oscillation
- `6ω` reflects dual-field harmonics
- `9ω` amplifies harmonic gain and coherence envelope

Together, they create a tunable phase space used for resonance testing and scalar potential observation.

## ❓ How does the system maintain lock?

Each node:
- Samples three sensors (magnetic, optical, thermal)
- Computes phase error and adjusts DDS output
- Actively compensates using I²C DAC amplitude shaping
- Reports convergence or drift via serial/log output

Lock is defined as:
- Phase error < ±1.0°
- Harmonic Gain Factor (HGF) > 0.8

---

## ❓ Is this simulation or real hardware?

This is a fully real-world deployable hardware system:
- All STL files printable via resin or FDM printers
- Sensors and DAC/ADC boards are off-the-shelf
- Firmware is real and tested
- All test logs and convergence plots are actual captured data

---

## ❓ How do the nodes communicate?

They do **not** network via traditional means. Scalar alignment is emergent:
- Nodes align field-wise, not via Wi-Fi or serial bus
- Field feedback is self-correcting via sensed phase drift
- Only central serial output or manual data logging is used

---

## ❓ Could this system affect gravity?

TunerCore is not designed to alter gravity, but its geometry and harmonic coherence are designed to **observe and visualize** possible gravitational lensing behavior if scalar convergence exceeds threshold.

No anti-gravity claims. All effects must be experimentally verified.

---

## ❓ Why pyramids?

The pyramid geometry:
- Naturally focuses wave energy toward a point
- Enables internal sensor placement along field vectors
- Matches the 21-node spherical convergence array with minimum void space
- Structurally resonates cleanly in harmonic envelopes

---

## ❓ Is this legally safe for defense review?

Yes:
- No weaponized output  
- No optical targeting system  
- Scalar field is non-ionizing  
- Power levels are under typical consumer device thresholds  
- System is open-source and non-classified

This system is **observable, not weaponized**.

---

## ❓ What happens if one node fails?

Node failure is localized:
- Remaining nodes self-adjust
- The array’s coherence score may drop but remains functional
- Worst-case result is loss of convergence precision, not system failure

---

## ❓ Can this be scaled?

Yes:
- Arrays of 21, 42, 84, etc. can be mathematically calculated for spherical packing and convergence control
- Each node operates independently with its own feedback loop

---

## ❓ Who is this for?

- Advanced materials researchers  
- Harmonic field scientists  
- Defense and aerospace R&D  
- Gravitational interaction experimenters  
- Tesla-logic builders seeking real-world, verifiable field effects
